# run_analysis.R

## files
* train/X_train.txt: training data
* test/X_test.txt: test data
* train/y_train.txt: train label data
* test/y_test.txt: test label data
* train/subject_train.txt: subject numbers for training observations
* test/subject_test.txt: subject numbers for test observations

## variables
* tot_data: contains joined train and test observations
* tot_labels: contains joined labels for train and test observations
* tot_subject: contains joined list of subjects for train and test observations
* act_labels: contains a table mapping activity codes and text labels
* cols: contains the list of numerical indices and names for all columns that contain "mean" or "std" in their description, as generated by the function 'gen_cols'.
* tot_set: contains total set of observations combined with the corresponding activity labels and subject numbers.
* averages: stores the final result, grouped by activity and subject with the average value of all features for each group.

## transformations
* tot_data is filtered down to include only the desired columns by using 'select' with the numerical indices provided by cols[[1]] to return only those columns contained mean or std values.
* the numerical activity codes in tot_labels are replaced with their appropriate text labels by using the 'match' function to match the values in tot_labels with those in the first column of act_labels, and retrieving the corresponding text label in the second column of act_labels
* tot_set is generated by combining tot_data, tot_labels, and tot_subjects using the 'cbind' function.
* the names of the columns in tot_set are replaced by those provided by cols[[2]].
* averages is generated by using the 'dplyr' library to chain the 'group_by' and 'summarize_all' functions.

#  run_analysis_functs.R

## join_tabs
Formats the provided file paths w/ the folder path in the variable 'folder' using the 'file.path' function, then reads the files using the 'read.table'
function and finally joins them into one table using the 'rbind' function.

## gen_cols
Uses the 'grep' function to retrieve the indices and names of those columns with "mean" or "std" in their names from the file "features.txt", remove non-alphabetic characters from the names and then places them in a list called 'cols'.
